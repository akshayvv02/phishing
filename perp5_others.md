This is a sophisticated form of phishing where attackers compromise a vendor's email system and use it to send seemingly legitimate invoices or requests for information to their customers (your company). This can be particularly effective as the emails come from a trusted source.
While these types may not be as common as some of the others we've discussed, they represent evolving tactics that cybercriminals use to target workplaces. 

Clone Phishing:
This type of attack uses a legitimate, previously delivered email and creates an almost identical version with malicious content. The attacker sends the cloned email from a spoofed address, claiming to be a resend or updated version of the original. This can be especially effective in workplace settings where employees frequently receive updated versions of documents or communications. <br>

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Phishing:
While not strictly an email-based attack, MitM phishing can affect workplace communications. In this type of attack, the attacker intercepts communications between two parties (e.g., an employee and a client) and impersonates both sides to gain information. This can be particularly dangerous in business settings where sensitive information is frequently exchanged.<br>

Search Engine Phishing:
This method involves creating fake websites and getting them indexed by search engines. When employees search for certain terms related to their work, they might click on these malicious sites. While not directly email-based, this can lead to further phishing attempts or malware infections in the workplace.<br>

Social Media Phishing:
As many workplaces use social media for business purposes, attackers may use these platforms to initiate phishing attempts. This could involve creating fake profiles of companies or executives and reaching out to employees through these platforms.<br>

Cloud Storage Phishing:
With the increasing use of cloud storage in workplaces, attackers may send phishing emails that appear to be shared documents from services like Google Drive or Dropbox. These often bypass email filters because they come from legitimate domains. <br>

Vendor Email Compromise (VEC):
This is a sophisticated form of phishing where attackers compromise a vendor's email system and use it to send seemingly legitimate invoices or requests for information to their customers (your company). This can be particularly effective as the emails come from a trusted source.
